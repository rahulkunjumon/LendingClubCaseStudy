# Lending Club
* We are working for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company
* receives a loan application, the company must decide for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. The data analysis is on the given loan data and the recomendations are provided for approval/rejection

## General Information
- This is a case study for Upgrad AI/ML program students 
- Given a data set we are trying to provide insights and advice to loan investors as what loan to apporve and why with relevant graphs
- The data set given consists of applicants dmeographics along with a data trending on current, charged off and fully paid loans 


## Technologies Used
- Python 3.5
- Anaconda 3

## Conclusions
- Its evident that around 16 percent of the loan is charged off when compared with the fully paid Loans.  Rise in this percentage over 20, would lead to drastic loss as per Industry standards
- That most loan charged off are in the range of 6k to 16k. We must stricten the scrutiny of loans where request is in this particular range
-  For interest below 10%,  defaulting is low. It rises steep for interest above 10-16%.It is advisable to provide short term loan at lower interest rate than higher interest rate loans
- Borrowers with income ranging from 30k – 50k seems to have higher default rates. This needs to be evaluated as it can be due to higher number of loans been taken by this income group. This shall be evaluated in Bivariate Analysis
- Higher the DTI, higher is the chance to default. Loan approval needs to be scrutinized for DTI higher that 10.
- Most of the loans taken were of 36 months duration. But the ratio of Default to full payment is higher for 60 months loan duration (ie, around 33 percent) which is high.Loan with higher duration needs to be scrutinized to see the long-term capability of the borrower
- Most loans are taken by borrowers with 10+ years of employment, but, there is no strong ratio which describes them to be defaulted. Hence, we don’t have any significant conclusions on the same
- Borrowers living in Rented or a Mortgaged house, tends to default 15 percent more than those who have own home. Its not advisable to give loans to Borrowers living in Rented or a Mortgaged house without scrutiny of their purchasing power.
- Borrowers with installment size of 200 to 400 tends to default more. But this can be attributed to higher quantity of loans been taken in this range. But we also see a trend where higher the Installment size, higher is the chance to default  
- We Observe that lower income group people tends to take more loans as the scatter plot is very dense here. With further analysis, we have observed that loans were given to people where loan amount is higher than the annual income. Which adds to the risk factor and must be avoided
- It is observed that most loans are taken by borrowers with lower grade. We would be further analyzing how much do they default in the further analysis.
- Lower grade borrowers tends to take higher loans, as well as tends to default. Lending needs to be limited to employees with lower grades
- We had observed a reverse trend where verified Borrowers were defaulting more than the Not Verfied borrowers. This graph clearly tells that it's attributed to the higher quantity of loans being verified ones. No relevant conclusions are derived hence.
